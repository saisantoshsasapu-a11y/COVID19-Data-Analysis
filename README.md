# COVID-19 Data Analysis 📊

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to explore trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across different regions.  
The goal is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using Python.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert date formats
   - Normalize data per 100k population
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trends of cases and deaths over time
   - Comparison between countries
   - Correlation between vaccination rates and death rates
3. **Visualization**
   - Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots
   - Heatmaps and choropleth maps
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas (data cleaning & manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical analysis)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook Notebooks/Covid19_analysis.ipynb
